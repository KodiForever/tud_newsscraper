===============

A tool to extract data from websites of TU Dresden. This is currently in use on [fsr-verkehr.de](http://www.fsr-verkehr.de/) as a ticker on its homepage.


Usage
-----

Basically there are two php files `view/news.php` and `view/calendar.php` which both emit HTML-snippets that contain a rendered version of all the feeds defined in `model/news/faculties/*`, respectively `model/calendar/faculties`. For the case of [fsr-verkehr.de](http://www.fsr-verkehr.de/) these snippets are then dynamically added to the DOM via AJAX (jQuery).

(Partial) documentation of the individual functions is available through PHPDoc comments in the code.
